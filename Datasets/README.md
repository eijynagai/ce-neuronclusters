Input dataset files:

- Atlas_simbol-Circular.csv and id_simbol.rda: tables with equivalences between WB gen id and gen symbol used in this study

- ClusteringfinalAssignment.xlsx: tables with the manual/automatic assignment for final clusters. Number of Cells, average RNA count and average GENEcount per cluster is also included

- 'cured brain atlas PL and OH-Circular.csv': molecular atlas describing the expression pattern of the ~800 genes used to automatically identify cluster identities

- 'cured brain atlas PL and OH-CircularOtherMarkers.csv': same than above but it includes markers for muscle, rectal muscle, pharyngeal muscle, pharyngeal gland, coelomocyte, germline, hypoderm, excretory glia, sheat glia and intestine

- ParameterChoose.csv: manually chosen parameters to define clusters after second iteration analysis (3-SecondIterationClusterScreening)

- ParameterChoose3iteration.csv: manually chosen parameters to define clusters after third iteration analysis (5-ThirdIterationClusterScreening)

- rawdata.Neurons.rda: dataset containing the RNA count from 9,078 cells with neuronal markers from Cao et. al. 2017
