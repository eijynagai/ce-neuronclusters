Script files:

- FinalPlotAndClusteringMarkers.R: this script is used for plotting in tSNE space using final resulting clusters difined during the three clustering iterations.


Output files from FinalPlotAndClusteringMarkers.R:

- AllMarkers92.4WBid.csv: Table with markers analysis for all defined clusters.

- AverageExpression92.4.csv: Table with the average expression for all dectected genes in all the defiend clusters

- BoxPlotClusterMedianZscore_nPC_92_Resol_4.pdf: tSNE reduced space using final resulting clusters. Also includes for each cluster the corresponding boxplot with automatic assignment of neuronal identities (in red)
